# Case Sensitivity Validation Report

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - All text handling preserves original case

## Summary

The StudyBuddy application **correctly preserves case sensitivity** throughout the entire question lifecycle:
- Question insertion
- Question retrieval
- Answer comparison
- Display to users

**No lowercase normalization** is performed on any question data (stems, options, answers).

## Validation Details

### 1. Question Insertion (postgres_repo.py:333-371)

**File:** `studybuddy/backend/db/postgres_repo.py`
**Method:** `insert_questions()`

```python
# Lines 339-341: Direct assignment without transformation
options = question["options"]
answer = question["correct_answer"]
stem = question["stem"]

# Line 360: JSON encoding preserves case
payload["options"] = json.dumps(payload["options"])

# Lines 364-367: Direct SQL insertion
cur.execute(
    f"INSERT INTO question_bank ({columns}) VALUES ({placeholders})",
    tuple(payload.values())
)
```

**✅ Result:** Questions are stored exactly as provided, with original case preserved.

---

### 2. Question Retrieval (postgres_repo.py:239-295)

**File:** `studybuddy/backend/db/postgres_repo.py`
**Method:** `list_questions()`

```python
# Lines 287-292: Direct database fetch
cur.execute(query, params)
results = []
for row in cur.fetchall():
    question = dict(row)
    # JSONB columns are automatically deserialized by psycopg2
    results.append(question)
```

**✅ Result:** Questions are retrieved with their original case intact. No transformations applied.

---

### 3. Answer Comparison (postgres_repo.py:391-435)

**File:** `studybuddy/backend/db/postgres_repo.py`
**Method:** `log_attempt()`

```python
# Lines 404-410: Fetch correct answer as-is
cur.execute(
    "SELECT correct_answer, hash FROM question_bank WHERE id = %s",
    (question_id,)
)
question = cur.fetchone()

# Lines 412-413: CASE-SENSITIVE comparison
correct_answer = question["correct_answer"]
correct = selected == correct_answer
```

**✅ Result:** Answer comparison uses Python's `==` operator, which is **case-sensitive**.
- `"Hello" == "hello"` → `False`
- `"12" == "12"` → `True`
- `"A" == "a"` → `False`

---

### 4. Code Search Results

**Search:** `grep -r "\.lower()" studybuddy/backend`

**Findings:**
- ✅ **Zero occurrences** of `.lower()` on question data
- Only 2 occurrences found:
  1. `genai.py:50` - Subject name comparison only (not question content)
  2. `repository.py:122` - Environment variable checking only

**Search:** `grep -E "(stem|answer|option|selected|question)" + ".lower()"`

**Result:** ✅ **No matches found**

---

## Implication Examples

### Correct Behavior (Case-Sensitive)

| Question | Correct Answer | User Selects | Result |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| "What is 2+2?" | "4" | "4" | ✅ Correct |
| "What is 2+2?" | "Four" | "four" | ❌ Incorrect |
| "Capitalize this: hello" | "Hello" | "Hello" | ✅ Correct |
| "Capitalize this: hello" | "Hello" | "hello" | ❌ Incorrect |
| "What is the unit?" | "m/s" | "M/S" | ❌ Incorrect |

### Database Storage Validation

Questions are stored in PostgreSQL with:
- `text` data type (not `citext` - case-insensitive text)
- No SQL `LOWER()` or `UPPER()` functions applied
- Direct string comparisons in WHERE clauses (case-sensitive by default)

---

## Testing Recommendations

To validate case sensitivity end-to-end:

### 1. Create Test Questions

```python
test_questions = [
    {
        "stem": "What is the chemical symbol for Sodium?",
        "options": ["Na", "na", "NA", "nA"],
        "correct_answer": "Na",
        "subject": "science",
        "topic": "chemistry",
        "sub_topic": "Elements",
        "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
        "stem": "How do you write 'Hello' in Spanish?",
        "options": ["hola", "Hola", "HOLA", "HoLa"],
        "correct_answer": "Hola",
        "subject": "language",
        "topic": "spanish",
        "sub_topic": "Greetings",
        "difficulty": "easy"
    }
]
```

### 2. Expected Results

- User selects "Na" → ✅ Correct
- User selects "na" → ❌ Incorrect (different case)
- User selects "Hola" → ✅ Correct
- User selects "hola" → ❌ Incorrect (different case)

### 3. SQL Validation Query

```sql
-- Check question storage preserves case
SELECT
    stem,
    correct_answer,
    options
FROM question_bank
WHERE subject = 'science' AND topic = 'chemistry'
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## Conclusion

✅ **VALIDATED:** The StudyBuddy application maintains **strict case sensitivity** throughout:

1. **Storage:** Questions stored with original case in database
2. **Retrieval:** Questions fetched without case transformation
3. **Comparison:** Answers compared using case-sensitive `==` operator
4. **Display:** Questions shown to users with original formatting

**No changes needed** - the system correctly handles case-sensitive data as designed.

## Additional Notes

### Display Considerations

If you want to ensure proper case display in the frontend:

- **Question stems:** Already preserved ✅
- **Answer options:** Already preserved ✅
- **User input:** Should be captured exactly as typed ✅

### Future Enhancements (If Needed)

If case-insensitive matching is desired for specific question types:

1. **Add a field** to question schema: `case_sensitive: boolean`
2. **Modify comparison** in `log_attempt()`:
   ```python
   if question.get("case_sensitive", True):
       correct = selected == correct_answer
   else:
       correct = selected.lower() == correct_answer.lower()
   ```
3. **Default to case-sensitive** for math/science questions
4. **Allow case-insensitive** for text-heavy language questions

**Current behavior is correct for:**
- Math problems (formulas, units)
- Science (chemical symbols, proper nouns)
- Proper grammar exercises
- Code syntax questions
