# React Frontend and Cross-Platform Expansion Plan

**ðŸŽ¨ TOP PRIORITY: Make the frontend visually appealing with modern design, smooth animations, and delightful user experience**

## P0 â€“ Local React Drop-In
- Audit current UI flows described in `README.md` and map them to FastAPI endpoints.
- Scaffold a Vite + React + TypeScript app in `src/ui/web/` with ESLint/Prettier configured for ES2020 and 2-space indentation.
- Stand up a minimal design system: shared tokens in `src/core/theme/` and base components in `src/ui/web/components/`.
- Recreate the existing flows feature-by-feature in React, centralizing HTTP calls inside `src/services/apiClient.ts`.
- Verify locally with `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test`, documenting known gaps in `README.md`.

## P1 â€“ Shared Core for Web and Mobile
- Restructure into a monorepo (`apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/core`, `packages/ui`) using Turborepo or Nx to share configs and tooling.
- Bootstrap an Expo-managed React Native app in `apps/mobile` that mirrors the web routing model (Expo Router â†” React Router).
- Build `packages/ui` on React Native primitives with `react-native-web`, enabling both apps to consume the same components.
- Add Storybook (or Ladle) to exercise shared UI primitives across platforms and enforce accessibility checks.
- Introduce state management (React Query + Zustand or equivalent) and abstract platform-specific services in `packages/core/platform/`.

## P2 â€“ Backend Alignment and Contract Hardening
- Upgrade FastAPI schemas to Pydantic v2, generate OpenAPI docs, and create a TypeScript client in `packages/core/api` via `openapi-typescript`.
- Implement CORS, authentication guards, and rate limiting suitable for public clients.
- Expand unit and contract tests in `studybuddy/backend/tests/` (or new `tests/services/`) to lock down behaviors before shared deployment.
- Define CI gates for linting, testing, and coverage to protect the new monorepo structure.

## P3 â€“ Unified Render Deployment (Single Docker Image)
- Extend the existing backend `Dockerfile` to build the React app during the image build step (e.g., `npm install && npm run build` in a web stage, copy assets into FastAPI static directory).
- Serve the compiled React bundle via FastAPI (e.g., `studybuddy/backend/app.py` static mount) so one container hosts both UI and API.
- Configure the Render Web Service to use the new Docker image, supplying required environment variables and health check (`/healthz`).
- Add GitHub Actions workflows to lint/test, build the unified image, push to Renderâ€™s registry, and trigger deploy hooks.
- Establish Render monitoring, autoscaling, and alerting; document manual rollback steps in `README.md`.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Choose Turborepo vs. Nx and confirm Expo as the mobile runtime.
2. Draft component architecture and API contract docs for shared packages.
3. Prototype the P0 React app skeleton to validate the drop-in approach before reorganizing the repo.
