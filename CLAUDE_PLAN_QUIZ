Objective
- Add a non-adaptive, timed Quiz mode alongside existing Practice.
- Show all questions at once, balanced difficulty mix (not tailored to child).
- Follow Eureka Math (EngageNY) testing style and current question language.
- Results include overall score and a table of incorrect items with explanations.
- Reduce repeats across recent history while allowing previously seen questions.

Scope
- Backend (FastAPI): models, endpoints, selection/grading services, schema.
- Frontend (React/TS): services, context, pages, welcome choice, routing, timer.
- Tests: unit + API (backend), unit + component (frontend), Eureka-style fixtures.
- Docs: README/USAGE/CLAUDE updates.

Phase 1 — Backend Foundations
1) Data Model (studybuddy/backend/models.py)
   - QuizSession: id, child_id, subject, topic, subtopic (nullable), status
     (active|completed|expired), duration_sec, difficulty_mix_config, started_at,
     submitted_at, score, total_questions.
   - QuizSessionQuestion: id, quiz_session_id, question_id, index,
     correct_choice, explanation, selected_choice (nullable), is_correct (nullable).

2) Schema (studybuddy/backend/db/sql/)
   - Create migration_add_quiz_sessions.sql with tables quiz_sessions,
     quiz_session_questions with indexes on child_id, created_at, and status;
     enum for status.
   - Include rollback strategy in migration file.
   - Create corresponding seed file (optional initial quiz sessions).
   - Create script: scripts/run_quiz_migration.sh for execution.
   - Test migration on local dev before applying to Supabase.

3) Data Mode Compatibility
   - Update in-memory repository (if exists) to support quiz sessions.
   - Ensure both memory and Supabase modes have feature parity.
   - Add mode-specific tests for quiz persistence.

4) Routes (studybuddy/backend/routes/quiz.py)
   - Authentication & Authorization:
     * All quiz endpoints require bearer token authentication.
     * Validate child_id belongs to authenticated user.
     * Prevent cross-user quiz access.
     * Rate limit quiz creation (e.g., max 5 active quizzes per child).

   - POST /quiz/sessions
     Input: child_id, subject, topic, subtopic?, question_count, duration_sec,
            difficulty_mix (e.g., {easy:0.3,medium:0.5,hard:0.2}).
     Validation:
       * Check for existing active quiz for same child/subject/topic.
       * Return 409 Conflict with active session_id if exists.
       * Validate question_count (min: 5, max: 30).
       * Validate duration_sec (min: 300, max: 7200).
     Behavior: select fixed set of questions upfront; unseen-first, allow repeats
               if inventory is thin; math → Eureka standards; return session meta
               and questions (without answers/explanations).

   - GET /quiz/sessions (list)
     Return: child's recent quiz sessions with status, score, created date.
     Supports pagination and filtering by subject/status.

   - GET /quiz/sessions/{quiz_id}
     Return: session state, remaining time (calculated from server timestamp),
             ordered questions (no answers/explanations).
     Auto-expire if 24+ hours since creation without submission.

   - POST /quiz/sessions/{quiz_id}/submit
     Input: [{question_id, selected_choice}]. Grade, persist per-item results,
            compute score. Return summary + incorrect-only table with explanations.
     Validation:
       * Verify session not already submitted.
       * Verify session not expired (return 410 Gone if expired).
       * Treat unanswered questions as incorrect.
       * Prevent double submission (idempotency).

   - POST /quiz/sessions/{quiz_id}/expire (optional)
     Mark session expired; frontend may auto-submit with current selections.

   - Session Lifecycle Rules:
     * Allow only 1 active quiz per child per subject/topic.
     * Auto-expire sessions 24 hours after creation if not submitted.
     * Prevent submission of expired sessions (return 410 Gone).

5) Services
   - Selection (studybuddy/backend/services/quiz_selection.py)
     * Mixed difficulty sampler honoring proportions; no per-child tailoring.
     * Unseen-first per child with recent-repeat window (e.g., avoid last K attempts
       per subtopic); allow repeats when necessary.
     * Verify duplicates do not appear within the same quiz.
     * For math, ensure Eureka Math alignment (reuse genai.py hooks). Generate
       missing inventory via existing AI/mock pipeline with deduplication.
     * Return error if insufficient questions available (min 5 required).

   - Grading (studybuddy/backend/services/quiz_grading.py)
     * Single-pass grading on submission. Persist selected_choice, is_correct,
       score aggregation, submitted_at.
     * Calculate time_taken from started_at to submitted_at.
     * Track unanswered_count for analytics.

   - Repo (studybuddy/backend/db/postgres_repo.py)
     * Create/fetch/submit/expire quiz sessions and items.
     * Check for active session conflicts.
     * List quiz history with pagination.

   - Logging (with prefix [QUIZ]):
     * Quiz creation: child_id, subject, topic, question_count, difficulty_mix.
     * Selection: inventory depth, unseen count, fallback triggers.
     * Submission: time_taken, score, unanswered_count.
     * Generation fallback: OpenAI calls, deduplication hits.
     * Errors: insufficient inventory, generation failures, auth failures.

Phase 2 — Frontend Foundations (src/ui/web)
1) Services (src/ui/web/src/services/quiz.service.ts)
   - create(params), list(childId), get(sessionId), submit(sessionId, answers[]).
   - Error handling for network failures, session not found, expired sessions.

2) Context (src/ui/web/src/contexts/QuizContext.tsx)
   - State: session meta, questions[], answers map, isSubmitting, timeLeft,
            isLoading, error.
   - Actions: initializeQuiz, selectAnswer(qid, choice), submitQuiz,
              startTimer/autoSubmitOnTimeout, reset.
   - Timer Management:
     * Store quiz start time from backend (server timestamp).
     * Calculate remaining time on each sync with backend.
     * Sync timer every 10s with backend via GET /quiz/sessions/{id}.
     * Handle timezone differences with UTC timestamps.
     * Auto-resume timer on page refresh.
     * Trigger auto-submit at 0:00 with current selections.

3) Welcome Choice
   - On child selection screen, add two primary actions:
     * Practice → existing flow.
     * Quiz → opens setup modal to choose subject/topic/subtopic?, question_count,
              duration_sec, difficulty mix preset (e.g., Balanced 30/50/20).
   - Show warning if active quiz already exists for selected topic.

4) Pages
   - QuizPage (src/ui/web/src/pages/QuizPage.tsx)
     * Responsive design:
       - Desktop (1440px): 2-column question grid.
       - Tablet (768px): Single column, sticky timer at top.
       - Mobile (375px): Single column, compact timer, scroll to submit.
     * Consider "Jump to question" navigation for 10+ questions.
     * Ensure touch-friendly radio buttons (min 44px tap target).
     * Sticky timer bar and submit button.
     * All questions rendered at once.
     * Radio selection per question.
     * Warn on submit if unanswered questions remain.
     * Auto-submit on timeout.
     * Loading States:
       - Quiz loading: Skeleton loader for question list.
       - Submission: Disabled submit button with "Grading your answers...".
     * Error States:
       - Network failure: Retry button with error message.
       - Session not found: Redirect to dashboard with toast notification.
       - Session expired: Show message + redirect to setup new quiz.

   - QuizResults (src/ui/web/src/pages/QuizResults.tsx)
     * Summary: total correct, total, percent, time taken.
     * Table: incorrect questions with child's answer, correct choice,
       explanation "how to get the right answer".
     * Action buttons: "Review All Questions", "Start New Quiz", "Back to Dashboard".
     * Loading State: Skeleton loader while fetching results.
     * Error State: Retry if submission failed.

5) Routing
   - Add /quiz/new, /quiz/:id, /quiz/:id/results.

6) Dashboard Integration
   - Add "Start Quiz" card next to "Continue Practice" on Dashboard.
   - Show badge with active quiz count.
   - Add quiz history section in ProgressPanel with toggle.

Phase 3 — Behavior, Policy, and Style
1) Difficulty mix presets
   - Balanced: 30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard (default). Advanced override allowed.

2) Eureka style & language
   - Maintain existing stem/choice phrasing and formatting.
   - Math questions: Eureka-aligned wording and reasoning steps in explanations.

3) Repeat reduction
   - Add recent-attempt window constraints with safe fallback.
   - Avoid questions seen within last K attempts/days per child+subtopic.
   - Allow repeats when inventory constrained.

4) Non-adaptive quiz
   - Fixed set at creation; no mid-quiz adaptation.

5) Duration Defaults (with custom override)
   - Smart defaults: Easy: 60s, Medium: 90s, Hard: 120s (weighted by mix).
   - Formula: duration = (count_easy * 60) + (count_medium * 90) + (count_hard * 120).
   - Example: 10 questions (30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard) = 870s ≈ 15 min.
   - UI shows both question count slider and duration preview.
   - Allow manual override with min/max constraints.

6) Design & Visual Testing
   - Follow S-Tier design principles from /context/design-principles.md.
   - Use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography.
   - Reuse theme colors by subject; match Practice component styles.
   - Implement micro-interactions (hover states, focus rings, transitions 150-300ms).
   - Confirm accessible labels, keyboard navigation, and focus states.
   - Add submit confirmation modal if unanswered questions remain.

   - After implementation, run Quick Visual Check:
     * Navigate to quiz setup, quiz page, results page.
     * Capture full-page screenshots at 1440px viewport.
     * Check console for errors with mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages.

   - Before PR, run Comprehensive Design Review:
     * Test responsiveness at 375px, 768px, 1440px.
     * Verify keyboard navigation and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
     * Test all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled).
     * Validate loading states, error states, empty states.

Phase 4 — Testing (follow "end of Eureka module" style)
Backend (Pytest)
 - Selection tests: difficulty proportions, unseen-first with fallback, Eureka hook.
 - Selection: Returns requested question_count with approx. mix 30/50/20 (±1 item).
 - Selection: Prioritizes unseen questions; falls back cleanly when inventory low.
 - Selection: Avoids selecting same question twice in one quiz.
 - Selection: Invokes Eureka alignment path for math; uses AI/mock when thin.
 - API tests: create returns questions without answers; submit grades correctly and
   returns incorrect-only table with explanations; timeout behavior path.
 - API: Create quiz hides correct answers/explanations pre-submit.
 - API: Submit grades accurately; returns score and incorrect-only with explanations.
 - API: Submitting with unanswered items treats them as incorrect.
 - API: Timeout path auto-submits and grades current selections.
 - API: Results persisted and retrievable; session status transitions correct.

Frontend (Vitest)
 - QuizContext: initialize → select → submit → timeout auto-submit.
 - QuizContext: initialize → selectAnswer → submit → resets on new quiz.
 - Timer: counts down, triggers autoSubmit at 0, prevents double submit.
 - Services: create/get/submit call correct endpoints and handle payload.
 - QuizPage: renders all questions; timer countdown; disabled after submit.
 - QuizResults: shows summary and incorrect-only with explanations.
 - Fixtures: tests/fixtures/eureka_*.json with representative items.

Frontend E2E (Playwright)
 - Welcome choice displays Practice and Quiz; Quiz path navigates correctly.
 - Quiz setup modal: choose subject/topic, count, duration, mix; creates session.
 - Quiz page: all questions visible; select answers; sticky timer visible.
 - Submit flow: warns on unanswered; submits; disables interactions post-submit.
 - Results page: shows summary and incorrect-only table with explanations.
 - Timeout path: let timer elapse; auto-submit triggers; results rendered.
 - Persistence: page reload on results preserves state via API fetch.

Concurrency & Security Tests
 - Cannot create multiple active quizzes for same child/subject/topic.
 - Cannot access quiz session belonging to different user.
 - Cannot submit answers for questions not in the quiz.
 - Cannot submit same quiz twice (idempotency).

Timer & Expiry Tests
 - Timer syncs with backend every 10s, handles drift.
 - Page refresh resumes timer accurately.
 - Auto-submit triggers exactly at 0:00.
 - Expired sessions return 410 and cannot be submitted.

Performance Tests
 - Quiz with 20 questions loads in <2s.
 - Submission processes in <1s for 20 answers.
 - Frontend doesn't freeze during answer selection.

Accessibility Tests (WCAG 2.1 AA)
 - Screen reader announces timer updates every 60s.
 - All questions navigable via keyboard (Tab, arrow keys).
 - Radio buttons have visible focus indicators.
 - Submit button accessible via Enter key.
 - Results table has proper header associations.

Coverage
 - Target ≥80% coverage on new code.

Phase 5 — Docs & Rollout
 - README.md: add Quiz mode overview and API snippets.
 - USAGE_FILE.md: add create/get/submit examples and flows, comparison table.
 - CLAUDE.md: architecture notes for fixed-set timed quiz.
 - context/design-principles.md: quiz-specific patterns if needed.
 - AGENTS.md: if quiz selection logic is complex enough to document.
 - API documentation: consider adding Swagger/OpenAPI spec.
 - User guide: "Practice vs Quiz Mode" comparison table.
 - Update .env.example with ENABLE_QUIZ_MODE flag description.
 - Feature flag (optional): ENABLE_QUIZ_MODE=1 for staged rollout.

Phase 6 — Integration & Monitoring
1) Dashboard Integration
   - Add "Start Quiz" card next to "Continue Practice" on Dashboard.
   - Show badge with active quiz count.
   - Add quiz history section in ProgressPanel with toggle.
   - Progress Integration:
     * Add tab: "Practice" vs "Quizzes" in ProgressPanel.
     * Show quiz history: date, topic, score, time.
     * Aggregate stats: average quiz score, topics mastered.
     * Keep separate from adaptive practice metrics initially.

2) Progressive Rollout
   - Enable ENABLE_QUIZ_MODE=1 in .env.
   - Test with internal users first.
   - Monitor error logs for [QUIZ] prefix.
   - Collect feedback on timing, difficulty mix, explanations.

3) Performance Monitoring
   - Track P95 latency for quiz creation (<2s target).
   - Track P95 latency for submission (<1s target).
   - Monitor OpenAI API usage for generation fallback.
   - Alert on high failure rates (>5%).
   - Monitor concurrent quiz attempts per child.

4) User Feedback Loop
   - Add optional post-quiz feedback modal.
   - Track: "Was duration appropriate?" "Were questions fair?"
   - Use feedback to tune default durations and difficulty mixes.
   - Monitor completion rates and abandonment patterns.

Non-Goals (initial)
 - Quiz history UI beyond results page (moved to Phase 6).
 - Teacher dashboards and custom mixes beyond presets.
 - Adaptive difficulty within quiz (future enhancement).
 - Question bookmarking or favoriting.
 - Print/export quiz results.

Resolved Questions
✓ Default duration per question_count: Use smart defaults (60-90-120s by difficulty)
  with weighted formula, allow custom override with min/max constraints.
✓ Include quiz performance in ProgressPanel: YES, add "Practice" vs "Quizzes" toggle
  tab with separate metrics and history.

Open Questions
 - Should we allow quiz pause/resume or enforce single-session completion?
 - Include explanations for correct answers too, or only incorrect?
 - Allow quiz retry with same questions or always generate new set?

Milestones
 - M1: Backend endpoints + schema + selection/grading services with tests.
 - M2: Frontend services/context/pages + welcome choice + E2E happy path.
 - M3: Repeat-reduction tuning + design polish + coverage target met.
 - M4: Dashboard integration + monitoring + progressive rollout.
