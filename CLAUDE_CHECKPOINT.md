# CLAUDE CHECKPOINT

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Session Context**: Debugging Supabase signup issue where values are not being saved in the database

## Problem Summary
The signup endpoint works (returns 201 with parent data), but user data is not being persisted to the Supabase database. This affects the static page signup functionality.

## What We Accomplished ‚úÖ

### Database Setup (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Created Supabase tables using `supabase db reset`
- ‚úÖ Applied RLS policies via Docker exec
- ‚úÖ Seeded data successfully:
  - 2 standards in `standards` table
  - 3 questions in `question_bank` table
  - 2 pacing presets in `pacing_presets` table
- ‚úÖ Local Supabase running on http://127.0.0.1:54321

### Application Configuration (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Created `.env` file from `.env.example`
- ‚úÖ Set `STUDYBUDDY_DATA_MODE=supabase`
- ‚úÖ Configured local Supabase URL and service role key
- ‚úÖ Added `/reset-cache` endpoint to clear repository cache

### Investigation Results (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Identified the root cause: Python dependency compatibility issue
- ‚úÖ Confirmed API endpoints work (signup returns proper response)
- ‚úÖ Verified database connection works (can query data directly)
- ‚úÖ Found that repository cache was using memory mode instead of Supabase

## Root Cause Analysis üîç

**Issue**: Supabase Python client (v2.4.0) has dependency conflicts with `gotrue` ‚Üí `httpx` client

**Error**: `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'`

**Impact**:
- Repository silently falls back to memory mode
- API responses look successful but data isn't persisted
- No errors shown in application logs

## Current State üìç

### Environment
- Local Supabase running and accessible
- Development server running on port 8000
- Environment configured for Supabase mode
- Database tables created and seeded

### Code Changes Made
1. Created `.env` file with Supabase configuration
2. Added `/reset-cache` endpoint in `health.py:14-17`
3. No other code modifications needed

### What's NOT Working
- Data persistence to Supabase (falls back to memory storage)
- Supabase Python client initialization fails silently

## Next Steps / Solutions üöÄ

### Option 1: Direct PostgreSQL Connection (Recommended)
- Install `psycopg2-binary`
- Create a PostgreSQL-only repository that bypasses Supabase Python client
- Connect directly to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres`

### Option 2: Use Hosted Supabase
- Create project at supabase.com
- Use hosted URL instead of local instance
- Python client works better with hosted instances

### Option 3: Fix Package Versions
- Try different combinations of supabase/gotrue/httpx versions
- This is more complex due to rapidly evolving ecosystem

## Files Modified
- `/Users/atyagi/codevault/testAI/.env` (created from example)
- `/Users/atyagi/codevault/testAI/studybuddy/backend/routes/health.py:14-17` (added reset-cache endpoint)

## Key Commands for Resumption
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status

# Restart dev server
make dev

# Reset repository cache
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reset-cache

# Test signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Check if data persisted
docker exec -i supabase_db_testAI psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT * FROM parents;"
```

## Important Notes
- The application architecture is sound
- Supabase setup is correct
- This is purely a Python SDK compatibility issue
- Production deployment with hosted Supabase should work fine
