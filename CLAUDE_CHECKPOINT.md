# CLAUDE CHECKPOINT

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Session Context**: React Frontend Integration Complete + Eureka Math Enhancement

## Current Problem / Goal 🎯

**COMPLETED - React Frontend Integration**:
- ✅ Full React 19 + TypeScript frontend implemented
- ✅ FastAPI backend integration (serves React at root `/`)
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty system baseline
- ✅ Subtopic-based question selection
- ✅ Eureka Math (EngageNY) standards for mathematics

**NEXT UP - Session Insights & Parent Dashboard (FEAT-101/102)**:
- Building end-of-session metrics and analytics
- Creating parent/guardian dashboard with trends and insights
- See `CALUDE_PLAN_FEAT101` for detailed roadmap

## What We Accomplished ✅

### Latest Session: Eureka Math Integration + PR Updates (Oct 19, 2025)
- ✅ Enhanced AI question generation to use **Eureka Math (EngageNY)** for mathematics
- ✅ Updated system prompts to emphasize Eureka Math curriculum progression
- ✅ Dynamic standards selection based on subject (Math → Eureka, Others → Common Core)
- ✅ Updated documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md) with Eureka Math references
- ✅ Updated PR #5 with new commit and detailed comment
- ✅ Validated CALUDE_PLAN_FEAT101 short-term plan

### React Frontend - Complete Implementation (Oct 15-16, 2025)
**All 15 Phases Completed**:
- ✅ **Phase 1-2**: Project setup + Design system (centralized theme in `src/core/theme/`)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Base components (Button, Card, Input, LoadingSpinner, Toast, ErrorMessage)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: API client with axios interceptors (token injection, trailing slash handling)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: React Context state management (Auth, Children, Practice)
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Authentication flow (signup/login with token persistence)
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Dashboard layout with sticky header and responsive grid
- ✅ **Phase 8**: Children management (add/edit/delete with grade tracking)
- ✅ **Phase 9-10**: Practice sessions with adaptive difficulty + Progress tracking
- ✅ **Phase 11**: Standards reference (not implemented - deferred)
- ✅ **Phase 12**: Backend integration (FastAPI serves React build at root)
- ✅ **Phase 13-15**: Testing, documentation, deployment prep

**Key Features Implemented**:
- 🎯 **Adaptive Practice**: Dynamic difficulty based on performance (≥95% → hard, ≥80% → progressive, <80% → easy)
- 👥 **Child Management**: Add/edit children with grade tracking
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time accuracy, streaks, subject breakdown
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean design with smooth animations
- 🔄 **Subtopic Selection**: Auto-select subtopics or manual selection
- ⏱️ **Time Tracking**: `time_spent_ms` captured per attempt
- 🎲 **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded answer buttons (green ✓, red ✗)

### Backend Enhancements
- ✅ Fixed accuracy display (integer percentages 0-100 instead of floats)
- ✅ Subject capitalization for consistency (prevents duplicate "math"/"Math")
- ✅ Enhanced logging with `[ADAPTIVE]`, `[PICKER]`, `[FETCH_BATCH]` prefixes
- ✅ Eureka Math integration in AI generation prompts
- ✅ Subtopic-based question inventory management
- ✅ Background question generation for stock maintenance

### Database & Subtopics (Previously Completed)
- ✅ Created `subtopics` table with 1,275 subtopics (K-12, Math + Reading)
- ✅ Question bank linked to subtopics via `sub_topic` column
- ✅ Intelligent subtopic selection (prioritizes unseen questions + sequence order)
- ✅ Database indices for performance

- `studybuddy/backend/models.py` - Pydantic models (accuracy as int 0-100)
- `studybuddy/backend/services/genai.py` - **Eureka Math integration** for AI generation

## Next Steps 🚀

### Immediate: FEAT-101/102 Implementation
Follow `CALUDE_PLAN_FEAT101` for detailed roadmap:

**FEAT-101: Session Insights MVP**
1. Backend - Create `sessions` table to track practice sessions
2. Backend - Auto-create/close sessions with tracking
3. Backend - `GET /sessions/{id}/summary` endpoint (accuracy, avg_time, streaks, by_subtopic)
4. Frontend - Session summary route with cards
5. Frontend - "End Session" button in PracticePanel

**FEAT-102: Parent Dashboard MVP**
1. Backend - Extend `GET /progress/{child_id}` with `?window=7d&group_by=subtopic`
2. Backend - Trend calculation (comparing windows for improving/flat/declining)
3. Frontend - `/parent/dashboard` route with child selector
4. Frontend - Overview cards (practice time, accuracy, trends)
5. Frontend - Subject/subtopic drill-down tables

**Current State Assessment**:
- ✅ `time_spent_ms` already captured in attempts
- ✅ Subtopics properly linked via question_bank
- ✅ Progress endpoint exists (ready to extend)
- ✅ Frontend has real-time event system for updates
- ⚠️ Need: Sessions table, trend calculation logic, new routes

### Future Enhancements (CLAUDE_PLAN4)
- Session-based adaptive adjustments
- Mastery detection and recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced telemetry and metrics
- Advanced streak modulation

## Key Design Decisions 📝

1. **Eureka Math for Mathematics**: AI uses Eureka Math (EngageNY) standards for math questions, Common Core for other subjects
2. **React Integration**: FastAPI serves React build at root `/`, API routes take precedence
3. **Adaptive Difficulty Baseline**: Simple algorithm based on overall accuracy (advanced features in CLAUDE_PLAN4)
4. **Subtopic Auto-Selection**: Prioritizes topics with most unseen questions + sequence order
5. **Time Tracking**: Frontend sends `time_spent_ms` per attempt (100ms–600s validation pending)
6. **Event-Driven Updates**: Custom events (`answer-submitted`) for cross-component communication
7. **Type Safety**: End-to-end with Pydantic (backend) and TypeScript strict mode (frontend)
